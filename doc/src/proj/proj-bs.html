<h2 id="___sec0">Plan for the Talent course </h2>
An essential element of the Talent courses is to develop a large project(s) which allows you to study and understand
teoretical concepts in nuclear physics.  
These concepts will in turn allow you to interpret results from experiments and understand the pertinent physics in terms of the underlying forces and laws of motion.

<p>
Together with the regular lectures in the morning, the hope is that
during these three weeks you will be able to write and run a program
which implements at least one of the methods discussed during the
lectures.  The lectures will also cover additional material which aims
at giving you a broader view on what can be achieved with the methods
to be discussed. Combined with the 'hands-on' afternoon sessions, the
hope is that the lectures and the computational projects will together
allow you to achieve these goals. For those of you who would like to
get credits to be transferred to your home university, the project(s)
can be extended upon allowing you to include further elements to the
many-body methods. The load of the final project is estimated to be 
80 hours. In total, attendence at the course and doing
the final project amounts to seven ECTS. There is no credit transfer
for Northern-American students.

<h2 id="___sec1">Outline of the project(s) </h2>

<p>
What is outlined here are several paths that will allow you to develop
a program which can be used to study nuclear systems. In particular,
we will focus on two widely used many-body methods, coupled cluster
theory with its various approximations and Green's function theory.

<p>
Before we begin, we would however like to present a warm-up problem which 
contains
many of the basic elements of the many-body methods exposed in this course. Furthermore, the simple pairing 
model described below, provides us with  benchmark results to which we can compare 
the different many-body methods. The basic elements of the model (single-particle basis and Hamiltonian)
can easily be (if structured properly in your program) extended to studies of more realistic systems, either 
finite systems like nuclei or infinite nuclear matter.

<p>
The first part of the project is a traditional paper and pencil part, where the aim is to 
apply second quantization in order to set up the Hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized.
We will study this model the first two afternoons of the school.

<p>
At most, with four particles in four doubly degenerate single particle states and no broken pairs,
you will have a \( 6 \times 6 \) Hamiltonian matrix to diagonalize. Below, you will find a simple python program
which performs the diagonalization and plots the eigenvalues. Parts of this warm-up exercise are solved below. 
These aspects will be discussed partly during the lectures but also during some of the afternoon sessions.
Practical guidelines for code writing will also be discussed.

<p>
This exercise will allow us to start writing our first skeleton for a coupled cluster theory program at the so-called doubles level of truncation. It will also, for those of you who will prefer  to study Green's functions, serve as a 
starting point for developing the skeleton of a program for this method. The aim is to finish this part of the program during the first week.

<p>
With a program which then benchmarks the simple pairing model, we will turn our attention to more realistic systems.
Here we propose the following  paths that can be studied with either coupled cluster theory or Green's function theory. Many of the technicalities will be discussed at the lectures and the afternoon sessions during the last two weeks.

<ol>
<li> Studies of nuclear matter with a cartesian basis using coupled cluster theory at the level of doubles excitations</li>

<ul>
  <li> During the three weeks of the course we will mainly focus on two-particle and two-hole excitations</li> 
  <li> Focusing only on two-particle correlations in a finite cartesian basis, these can be compared with Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations in the infinite limit. The latter should represent exactly two-particle correlations to infinite order. A simple model for the nuclear force will be used.</li>
  <li> For the final project the code can be extended to include particle-hole correlations as well</li>
</ul>

<li> Studies of finite nuclei using coupled cluster theory at the level of doubles excitations only</li>

<ul>
  <li> Here we will provide Hartree-Fock based single-particle states and two-body interactions in an uncoupled scheme.</li>
  <li> The system to be studied is that of neutrons in harmonic oscillator traps.</li> 
  <li> For the final project, one can include singles excitations as well.</li>
</ul>

<li> The two above paths can be performed using Green's function as well.</li>

<ul>
  <li> Studies of infinite nuclear matter including two-particle and two-hole correlations using a cartesian basis.</li>
  <li> Comparison of two-particle correlations from Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations in the infinite limit</li>
</ul>

<li> Studies of finite nuclei with the Green's function method</li>

<ul>
  <li> Again we will provide Hartree-Fock based single-particle states and two-body interactions in an uncoupled scheme.</li>
  <li> The system to be studied is that of neutrons in harmonic oscillator traps.</li> 
  <li> For the final project, one can include self-consistently calculated single-particle energies as well.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

When working on the projects, we recommend strongly that you form teams of two-three participants. Every team
<b>must</b> have a <em>github account</em> where we can monitor your progress and give you appropriate feedback.

<p>
If you have not used version control before now, it is time to do so. 
Proper version control is central to a good ethical scientific conduct. 
We do require that you use some kind of version control software when working on the projects. We recommend strongly <a href="https://github.com/" target="_self">github</a>.

<p>
Furthermore, before coming to the course, we recommend that you refresh your knowledge on second quantization.
If your background in second quantization is rudimentary and mentioning of Wick's leave you gazing at the stars,
we recommend that you study the material at the course web site on <a href="http://nucleartalent.github.io/Course2ManyBodyMethods/doc/pub/secondquant/html/secondquant-bs.html" target="_self">second quantization</a>. Try in particular to do some of the exercises.

<p>
We will also require that you come with your own laptop and have installed either a

<ul>
<li> Fortran compiler or a</li> 
<li> c++ compiler</li>
</ul>

You can use Python as programming language as well, but normally the efficiency of Python for the problems addressed in this course is lower than for codes written in Fortran or c++. We recommend however that use Python as a scripting language for running codes and making plots, as well as using the ipython notebooks provided by us.

<h2 id="___sec2">Some basic ingredients for a successful numerical project </h2>

<p>
In when building up a numerical project there are several elements you should think of

<ol>
  <li> How to structure a code in terms of functions</li>
  <li> How to make a module</li>
  <li> How to read input data flexibly from the command line</li>
  <li> How to create graphical/web user interfaces</li>
  <li> How to write unit tests (test functions or doctests)</li>
  <li> How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only), in our case you think of a system and a solver class</li>
  <li> How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments</li>
  <li> How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)</li>
</ol>

The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:

<ol>
<li> New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)</li>
<li> Programs are run through convenient user interfaces</li>
<li> It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing</li> 
<li> Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,</li>
<li> Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="___sec3">The pairing model as warm-up problem </h2>

<p>
We present a simplified Hamiltonian consisting of an unperturbed
Hamiltonian and a so-called pairing interaction term. It is a model
which to a large extent mimicks some central features of atomic
nuclei, certain atoms and systems which exhibit superfluiditity or
superconductivity.  To study this system, we will use a mix of
many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and full
configuration interaction (FCI) theory. The latter will also provide us with
the exact answer.  When setting up the Hamiltonian matrix you will
need to solve an eigenvalue problem.

<p>
We define first the Hamiltonian, with a definition of the model space
and the single-particle basis. Thereafter, we present the various
exercises.

<p>
The Hamiltonian acting in the complete Hilbert space (usually infinite
dimensional) consists of an unperturbed one-body part, \( \hat{H}_0 \),
and a perturbation \( \hat{V} \).

<p>
We limit ourselves to at most two-body interactions, our Hamiltonian
is then represented by the following operators
$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{\alpha\beta}\langle \alpha |h_0|\beta\rangle
a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}+\frac{1}{4}\sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\langle \alpha\beta|
V|\gamma\delta\rangle a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger}a_{\delta}a_{\gamma},
$$

where \( a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \) and \( a_{\alpha} \) etc.&nbsp;are standard
fermion creation and annihilation operators, respectively, and
\( \alpha\beta\gamma\delta \) represent all possible single-particle
quantum numbers.  The full single-particle space is defined by the
completeness relation 
$$
\hat{{\bf 1}} = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{\infty}|\alpha \rangle \langle \alpha|.
$$

In our calculations
we will let the single-particle states \( |\alpha\rangle \) be
eigenfunctions of the one-particle operator \( \hat{h}_0 \). Note that the two-body part of the Hamiltonian 
contains anti-symmetrized matrix elements.

<p>
The above Hamiltonian acts in turn on various many-body Slater
determinants constructed from the single-basis defined by the one-body
operator \( \hat{h}_0 \).  As an example, the two-particle model space
\( \mathcal{P} \) is defined by an operator
$$
\hat{P} = \sum_{\alpha\beta =1}^{m}|\alpha\beta \rangle \langle
\alpha\beta|,
$$

where we assume that \( m=\dim(\mathcal{P}) \) and the full space is
defined by
$$
\hat{P}+\hat{Q}=\hat{{\bf 1}},
$$

with the projection operator
$$
\hat{Q} = \sum_{\alpha\beta =m+1}^{\infty}|\alpha\beta \rangle \langle
\alpha\beta|,
$$

being the complement of \( \hat{P} \).

<p>
Our specific model consists of \( N \) doubly-degenerate and equally
spaced single-particle levels labelled by \( p=1,2,\dots \) and spin
\( \sigma=\pm 1 \).  These states are schematically portrayed in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:schematic">1</a>.  The first two single-particle levels define
a possible model space, indicated by the label \( \mathcal{P} \).  The
remaining states span the excluded space \( \mathcal{Q} \).

<p>
We write the Hamiltonian as
$$ \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V} , $$

where
$$
\hat{H}_0=\xi\sum_{p\sigma}(p-1)a_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{p\sigma}
$$

and
$$
\hat{V}=-\frac{1}{2}g\sum_{pq}a^{\dagger}_{p+}
a^{\dagger}_{p-}a_{q-}a_{q+}.
$$

Here, \( H_0 \) is the unperturbed Hamiltonian with a spacing between
successive single-particle states given by \( \xi \), which we will set to
a constant value \( \xi=1 \) without loss of generality. The two-body
operator \( \hat{V} \) has one term only. It represents the pairing
contribution and carries a constant strength \( g \).

<p>
The indices
\( \sigma=\pm \) represent the two possible spin values. The interaction
can only couple pairs and excites therefore only two particles at the
time, as indicated by the rightmost four-particle state in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:schematic">1</a>. There one of the pairs is excited to the
state with \( p=9 \) and the other to the state \( p=7 \). The two middle
possibilities are not possible with the present model.  We label
single-particle states within the model space as hole-states. The
single-particle states outside the model space are then particle
states.

<p>
In our model we have kept both the interaction strength and the
single-particle level as constants.  In a realistic system like an
atom or the atomic nucleus this is not the case.

<p>

The filled circles indicate occupied particle  states while the empty circles represent vacant particle(hole)  states.  The spacing between each level \( p \) is constant in this picture.  The first two single-particle levels define our possible  model space, indicated by the label \( \mathcal{P} \).  The remaining  states span the excluded space \( \mathcal{Q} \).  The first state to  the left represents a possible ground state representation for a  four-fermion system. In the second state to the left, one pair is   broken. This possibility is however not included in our  interaction. <div id="fig:schematic"></div> </p></center>

<h2 id="___sec4">Exercise 1: Pairing Hamiltonian </h2>

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Show that the unperturbed Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_0 \) and \( \hat{V} \)
  commute with both the spin projection \( \hat{S}_z \) and the total spin
  \( \hat{S}^2 \), given by
$$
  \hat{S}_z := \frac{1}{2}\sum_{p\sigma} \sigma
  a^{\dagger}_{p\sigma}a_{p\sigma}
$$

and
$$
  \hat{S}^2 := \hat{S}_z^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\hat{S}_+\hat{S}_- +
  \hat{S}_-\hat{S}_+),
$$

where
$$
  \hat{S}_\pm := \sum_{p} a^{\dagger}_{p\pm} a_{p\mp}.
$$

This is an important feature of our system that allows us to
block-diagonalize the full Hamiltonian. We will focus on total spin
\( S=0 \).  In this case, it is convenient to define the so-called pair
creation and pair annihilation operators
$$
\hat{P}^{+}_p = a^{\dagger}_{p+}a^{\dagger}_{p-},
$$

and
$$
\hat{P}^{-}_p = a_{p-}a_{p+},
$$

respectively.

<p>
Show that you can rewrite the Hamiltonian (with \( \xi=1 \)) as
$$
\hat{H}=\sum_{p\sigma}(p-1)a_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{p\sigma}
-\frac{1}{2}g\sum_{pq}\hat{P}^{+}_p\hat{P}^{-}_q.
$$

Show also that Hamiltonian commutes with the product of the pair
creation and annihilation operators.  This model corresponds to a
system with no broken pairs. This means that the Hamiltonian can only
link two-particle states in so-called spin-reversed states.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Construct thereafter the Hamiltonian matrix for a system with no
  broken pairs and total spin \( S=0 \) for the case of the four lowest
  single-particle levels indicated in the
  Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:schematic">1</a>. Our system consists of four particles
  only.  Our single-particle space consists of only the four lowest
  levels \( p=1,2,3,4 \).  You need to set up all possible Slater
  determinants.  Find all eigenvalues by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian
  matrix.  Vary your results for values of \( g\in [-1,1] \).  We refer to
  this as the exact calculation. Comment the behavior of the ground
  state as function of \( g \).

<b>Solution.</b>
<div class="collapse-group">
<p><div class="collapse" id="exer_1_1">

<p>
We give first the final Hamiltonian matrix
$$
H = \left ( 
\begin{array}{cccccc}
2\delta -g & -g/2 & -g/2 & -g/2 & -g/2 & 0 \\
 -g/2 & 4\delta -g & -g/2 & -g/2 & -0 & -g/2 \\
-g/2 & -g/2 & 6\delta -g & 0 & -g/2 & -g/2 \\
 -g/2 & -g/2 & 0 & 6\delta-g & -g/2 & -g/2 \\
 -g/2 & 0 & -g/2 & -g/2 & 8\delta-g & -g/2 \\
0 & -g/2 & -g/2 & -g/2 & -g/2 & 10\delta -g 
\end{array} \right )
$$

The following python program diagonalizes the above Hamiltonian matrix for a given span of interaction strength values, performing both a full configuration interaction calculation and a truncated one. For the truncated case we leave out the \( 4p4h \) state. This means that in addition to the ground state we include the four possible \( 2p2h \) states. Such a calculation is normally called a configuration interaction calculation.

<p>
Numerically, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this
matrix. The lowest eigenvalue then corresponds to the ground state
energy. Numerically, we can generate the Hamiltonian matrix and find
the eigenvalue for any value of \( g \), effectively giving us the ground
state energy as a function of the strength of the interaction. We will
refer to that energy as the <em>exact</em> energy of the system.

<p>
From our results, we now see some important differences between FCI
and CI. Full configuration interaction is an exact method, but is only
possible if and only if we have a complete and finite SD basis for our
system. In practice, we usually don't have this. Non-complete
CI however, is always possible, but gives the only  approximative
results. The method is variational however, so we are always
guaranteed that the approximation will be equal or bigger to the true
result. 
Perturbation theory however, is non-variational and there is no guarantee that including higher orders in the 
perturbation gives an improved result, as we will see below.

<p>
In an FCI case, we are including all possible exictations to infinite
order, meaning we have all possible 1p1h SDs, all possible 2p2h SDs
and so on. In the CI case, we truncate those excitations somewhere. In
our example we limited the excitations to at most 2p2h. We still got
the contribution from those 2p2h excitation to infinite order. If we
were to draw the diagrams of the interactions that contribute to this
CI case, there would be an infinite number of them, as we can have
arbitrarily long chains of operators that still only have at most 2p2h
intermediate states.

We switch now to approximative methods, in our case Hartree-Fock
  theory and many-body perturbation theory. Hereafter we will define
  our model space to consist of the single-particle levels \( p=1,2 \).
  The remaining levels \( p=3,4 \) define our excluded space.  This means
  that our ground state Slater determinant consists of four particles
  which can be placed in the doubly degenerate orbits \( p=1 \) and \( p=2 \).
  Our first step is to perform a Hartree-Fock calculation with the
  pairing Hamiltonian.  Write first the normal-ordered Hamiltonian
  with respect to the above reference state given by four spin \( 1/2 \)
  fermions in the single-particle levels \( p=1,2 \). Define what is meant
  by a canonical Hartree-Fock case, a non-canonical case and a general
  case.  For all three cases, write down the normal-ordered
  Hamiltonian and draw the diagrammatic form of the Hamiltonian for all three cases.

<p>
<b>d)</b>
We will now set up the Hartree-Fock equations by varying the
coefficients of the single-particle functions. The single-particle
basis functions are defined as
$$
\psi_p = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\psi_{\lambda}.
$$

where in our case \( p=1,2,3,4 \) and \( \lambda=1,2,3,4 \), that is the first
four lowest single-particle orbits of Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:schematic">1</a>.  Set
up the Hartree-Fock equations for this system by varying the
coefficients \( C_{p\lambda} \) and solve them for values of \( g\in
[-1,1] \).  Comment your results and compare with the exact
solution. Discuss also which diagrams in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:diagrams">2</a> that
can be affected by a Hartree-Fock basis. Compute the total binding
energy using a Hartree-Fock basis and comment your results.

<p>
<b>e)</b>
We will now study the system using non-degenerate
Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory to third order in the
interaction.  If we exclude the first order contribution, all possible
diagrams (so-called anti-symmetric Goldstone diagrams) are
shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:diagrams">2</a>.

We limit now the discussion to the canonical Hartree-Fock case only.

<b>Solution.</b>
<div class="collapse-group">
<p><div class="collapse" id="exer_1_2">

<p>
We now turn to MBPT to the fourth order. We now get a lot of diagrams
that can contribute to the energy, so we limit our discussion to the
canonical HF-case only. All of the diagrams in the canonical case are
shown in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 above. In our case howeber, due the
nature of the pairign Hamiltonian, only few of these diagrams give
non-zero contributions. Using also the linked diagram theorem, where a
diagram is called unlinked if and only if it has a disconnected part
that is closed, we can eliminate some of the diagrams. Goldstones
linked-diagram theorem states that all unliked diagrams will cancel
agains the renormalization terms in RSPT, meaning that we can define
the energy and wave function in each order as a sum of linked diagrams
only. We can then disregard diagram 33 and 41.

<p>
Let us now go through all the diagrams and find those that vanish due
to having broken pairs, i.e., the diagrams that vanish due to our
specific interaction. Take for example diagram 1, which vanishes due
to having a term \( \langle ab\vert \hat{v} \vert ci\rangle \). From this
argument, we see that all four diagrams from figure 3 vanish. Similar
arguments shows that most diagrams in figure 4 also dissapear. Going
through all the diagrams, we see that 5, 6, 14 and 15 are the ones
that do not vanish for figure 4. For figure 5 we actually see that all
diagrams vanish again. For figure 6 we already found that 33 and 41
vanished due to being unlinked&mdash;the rest contribute to the
perturbation.

<p>
All diagrams for figure 3 and 5 vanished for our interaction, this is
definitly not a surprise, as those figures correspond to 1p1h and 3p3h
excitations respectively. As our reference state already has the four
particles positioned in two pairs, it goes without saying that and odd
number of particle excitations requires broken pairs and will
vanish. The same argument also explained why there were no diagrams
that vanished for figure 6. That figure shows the four-particle-four
hole excited states, but as we only have four particles in our system,
exciting all the particles will keep them collected in pairs, so we
get no ubroken pairs. For the diagrams in figure 4 however, we have
2p2h excitations. The diagrams that vanish correspond to the cases
where we excite one particle from either pair, or excite both
particles in one pair, but into different levels, leaving us with a
broken pair.

<p>
The expressions for these diagrams can easily be written in terms of a
simple Python program. Note however that for every diagram we do
actually perform loops over every single-particle state. As we will
see later this is extremely inefficient from a computational point
view. In our discussions of the projects below, we will rewrite the
computations of most diagrams in terms of efficient matrix-matrix
multiplications or matrix-vector multiplications.  The following
Python program gives us the final results for perturbation to fourth
order, where we also make a plot of the relative error in the
correlation energy. That is, we compare the computed correlation in
perturbation theory with the result from the exact diagonalization.

<p>
Running the Python program shows us 
the approximation to both second and third order are very
good when the interaction is weaker \( g\in[-0.5,0.5] \), but as the
interaction gets stronger the approximation worsens. We also
note that the third-order is actually worse than the second order for
a strong interaction! This result illuminates the difference between
perturbation theory and configuration interaction we noted earlier,
including higher-order terms can possibly give a worse result
for perturbation theory. For CI however, including more excitations
will never give a worse result. We also see the consequences of
perturbation theory not being a variational method, as both
approximations undershoot the true ground state correlation energy of
the system.

<p>
From the results, we note also that the fourth order MBPT approximation to
the correlation energy is better than the lower orders for \( g < 0 \), but
worse than the lower orders for \( g>0 \). Again this shows us an the
important point of MBPT. There is no guarantee that the approximation
will converge to the exact solution as we increase the order. In fact,
as we see in our case, increasing the order of the approximation might
actually give you a worse result! Also, we see that MBPT is not
variational, so we can't simply calculate the approximation of many
different orders and choose the smallest one, as we then run the risk
of undershooting the real ground state energy.
